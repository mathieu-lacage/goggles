# Diving goggles

What is special about these goggles ?

1. Both hands are free while swiming down
2. You can make them yourself
3. You can make corrective lenses to match your eyesight

## How they work

The basics of how these goggles work is described in the USPTO patent
[20170203159A1](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20170203159A1/en)
and in the presentation of the indiegogo campaign for 
[Hektometer](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hektometer-revolutionary-freediving-goggles#/)
goggles.

Because the patent is abandoned, and, Hektometer goggles have not been available 
for sale since 2020, this project documents how I made a pair for myself using
hardware from my local FabLab, [SoFAB](https://www.sofab.tv/).

## How to make one yourself

### What you need

1. For the inner flexible skirt:
   - A resin 3D printer. I used a [Formlab Form 3B+](https://formlabs.com/3d-printers/form-3b/).
   - Resin for flex parts. I used [Flexible 80A](https://formlabs.com/fr/materials/flexible-elastic/).

2. For the other 3D-printed parts:
   - A simple extrusion 3D printer
   - PETG or PLA filament

3. For the lenses:
   - Transparent Acrylic/PMMA/Plexiglas sheets (2mm and 3mm thick).
   - A router. I used an [Origin](https://www.shapertools.com/en-de/origin-overview). A manual router should work too 
     but it will be challenging to make accurate guides for the lens shapes.
   - Glue for acrylic sheets. I used [Acrifix 0192](https://www.plexiglas.de/files/plexiglas-content/pdf/technische-informationen/391-20-ACRIFIX-1R-0192-en.pdf)
   - a UV lamp to speed up the curing process for the acrylic glue I used. Alternatively, the sun is a fine replacement.

4. For assembly:
   - A silicon band to attach the left and right side of the goggles. I spent 4 EUR on
     [swedish-style swim goggles](https://malmsten.com/en/products/p/swim-goggles/swedish-goggles/swedish-goggles-classic/2168/2357/1710021)
     to reuse the band that came with them. You should be able to find a similar-looking pair in any swim store online. 
     [Replacement bands](https://malmsten.com/en/products/p/swim-goggles/swedish-goggles/swedish-goggles-spare-part-kit/2168/2357/1750001) 
     can often be bought separately.

5. For the lens correction:
   - A CNC if you can afford it for precision. I used a [Roland MDX-50](https://www.rolanddga.com/products/3d/mdx-50-benchtop-cnc-mill).
     Alternatively, if your correction prescription is limited to small-scale myopia, great care and 
     patience will replace the CNC if you are willing to live with
     imperfect corrective lenses. 
   - Sand paper, for wet use, grit sizes 150, 180, 240, 320, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 2000, 2500, 3000, 4000.
   - Polishing paste. I recommend a car headlight polishing kit as they are cheap, and are commonly available.
